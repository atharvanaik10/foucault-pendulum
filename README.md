## Modeling a Foucault pendulum
### What is a Foucault pendulum
A Foucault(foo-KOH) pendulum is a simple pendulum named after French physicist Léon Foucault initially developed as a way to demonstrate the Earth's rotation.

​A Foucault pendulum requires the pendulum to hang off of a point that does not restrict is motion in either the x or y directions. This means that, contrary to a grandfather clock pendulum, for example, a Foucault pendulum can also rotate. Hence, at any latitude other than the equator, the Foucault pendulum appears to rotate as the Earth rotates. This is because by suspending the pendulum freely, it oscillates in terms of a fixed point in the universe, rather than a fixed point on Earth. Hence, as the Earth rotates, the pendulum is still oscillating in one direction, but it appears as if it's rotating to a viewer on Earth.
